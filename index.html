            Forests play a crucial role in contributing to Earth's biosphere as well provide
            ecosystem services to human populations all around the world.
            The 20 largest forests in the world are becoming more vulnerable every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nations are charged with decisions of how to utilize these abundant resources through sustainable
            forest management programs. And more recently, nations are challenged in how to best protect these signficant
            ecosystems from increasing distruction ranging from urban sprawl and defortation to support industry, to natural
            disasters encompasing disease, invasive species, and climate change related events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The slow and steady decline in the percentage of forest area is alarming in the sense that if nations don't do more to protect these areas
            soon, will there be inevitable repercussions to all of life on earth?
